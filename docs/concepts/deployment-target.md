## Context

User story: https://github.com/open-component-model/MPAS/issues/2

Deployment Targets represent some piece of infrastructure that will be used to deploy the end result(s) of an MPAS pipeline. Examples of deployment targets might include:

- Kubernetes clusters
- Virtual Machines (not in scope for MVP)
- OCI Repositories (not in scope for MVP)
- Git Repositories (not in scope for MVP)

Targets will be consumed by the MPAS control plane when rendering the `ProductDeployment`. Therefore a Target should provide a reference to the appropriate access credentials for the targetd environment.

## Proposal

We will introduce a new Kubernetes Custom Resource named `Target`.  The primary purpose of the `Target` is to describe an access method for the target; therefore it is not necessary to have separate Kubernetes Custom Resources for each type.

The `Target` Custom Resource specify the `type` of target and contain a reference to a secret that provides access credentials for the target. When creating a `Target` is imperative that the correct kind of access credentials are present in the secret.

When the `Product` controller is generating the product deployment pipeline for a given `ProductDeployment`, it will fetch the target's specified in the `spec.targetRefs` field of the `ProductDeployment`. Depending on the type of target, the `Product` controller will generate an appropriate Kubernetes object.

For a `Target` with type `kubernetes`, the `Product` controller will generate a Flux `Kustomization` and configure the `spec.kubeConfig` field to point at the `Target`'s `spec.access` secret. Flux will then deploy the end-result of the `ProductDeployment` pipeline to the target cluster.

For a `Target` with type `ssh`, the `Product` controller will generate a `MachineManager` CustomResource and configure the credentials appropriately based on the `Target`'s access.

## Project Target Binding

As has been described in the other concept documents, the `ProductDeployment` manifest is generated by the `Project` controller based on a `ProjectSubscriptionBinding` and the `ProductInformation` contained in the OCM component. As part of this generate the `Project` controller needs to determine which targets are relevant for the `ProductDeployment`. This is achieved creating a link between a project and a target, which we call a `ProjectTargetBinding`.

Similar to `ProjectSubscriptionBinding`, `ProjectTargetBinding`'s allow for the definition of global or project level `Target`s which can be consumed by any user with the appropriate Kubernetes RBAC permissions.

One difference between the `ProjectTargetBinding` and the `ProjectSubscriptionBinding` is that `ProjectTargetBindings` should support ignoring particular products. Or said otherwise, the target would be disabled for a particular product.

## Unresolved Issues

The question of where the `Target` API defintion should live is open to debate. One suggestion is that it would live as part of the `Project` controller, where it will be used.

## Appendix A: APIs

### A.1. Target Kubernetes API Object

The API for a `Target` will be as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: mpas.ocm.software/v1alpha1
kind: Target
metadata:
  name: string # the name of the product deployment
  namespace: string # the storage namespace of the product deployment
spec:
  type: string # required can be one of: kubernetes, ssh, ociRepository
  access:
    secretRef:
      name: string
      namespace: string
```

### A.2 ProjectTargetBinding Kubernetes API Object

The API for a project ProjectTargetBinding should be as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: mpas.ocm.software/v1alpha1
kind: ProjectTargetBinding
metadata:
  name: string
  namespace: string
spec:
  projectRef:
    name: string
    namespace: string
    # ignore products is an optional field that denotes
    # products that should not be deployed to this target
    # it's behaviour could be similar to the sourceignore field
    # which supports wildcards and exclusion semantics (*, !)
    # could also be based on labels
    ignoreProducts: # (optional)
    - string
  targetRef:
    name: string
    namespace: string
```

## Appendix B: Glossary

#### Product

An MPAS Product is software that has been packaged using the Open Component Model. It contains both configuration resources, technical artifacts (such as Kubernetes manifests, docker images), localization & configuration rules and instructions that can be used by the MPAS to create a generate a product deployment pipeline.

#### Product Deployment

The `ProductDeployment` is a Kubernetes API object that specifies the information necessary to generate a product deployment pipeline. `ProductDeployment`'s are consumed by the Product controller.

#### Project

An MPAS Project is a collection of Products. Products are installed using OCM and GitOps. Products can be stored in one or more Git repositories that are managed by the Project.

The `Project` Kubernetes API object that contains the metadata required to create and manage an individual MPAS Project.

#### Subscription

A Subscription is request for an OCM component to be replicated from an delivery registry to a customer registry.

The `Subscription` Kubernetes API object specifies the details of the component, version constraints and the delivery & customer registries.

#### Project Subscription Binding

A Project Subscription Binding creates a relation between a Project and a component Subscription.

The `ProjectSubscriptionBinding` object contains a references to `Project` and `Subscription` objects. The Project controller watches `ProjectSubscriptionBinding` objects and creates `ProductDeployment` manifests.

#### Target

A Target is a deployment environment for the final result of an MPAS product generation pipeline.

The `Target` Kubernetes API object specifies the access details for the target. Creating or managing the target infrastructure is not the responsibility of the MPAS system.

#### Project Target Binding

A Project Target Binding creates a relation between a Project and a component Subscription.

The `ProjectTargetBinding` object contains a references to `Project` and `Target` objects. The Project controller will look for available `ProjectTargetBinding`'s whenever it is creating a `ProductDeployment`.

#### Repository

A Repository is a Git repository that is created to house products installed as part of an MPAS project.

Because the Flux Source controller already defines an object named `GitRepository`, for the MPAS we shall define a Kubernetes API object named `Repository` that is describes project git repositories.
