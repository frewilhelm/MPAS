## Context

User story: https://github.com/open-component-model/MPAS/issues/5

Packaging a product in an MPAS-compatible way requires a specific component structure and essential resources. This has to be described and documented, so that Solution Designers / Software Architects are able deliver MPAS-compatible products.

## Proposal

We propose the use of a dedicated `ProductDescription` manifest file. 

The purpose of the `ProductDescription` manifest is to specify a set of resources that can be used to build a product. 

It should also provide a textual description of a product that can be used for discovery. 

Finally (and out of scope for MVP), the product description may define a set of dependencies that are required to be installed before the product is deployed.

The final product deployment artifacts will be rendered by the `ocm-controller` via a pipeline that is dynamically generated by the MPAS control plane.

## Structure

The `ProductDescription` defines the elements that make up this pipeline:
- `source` (required): the resource containing the deployment artifact (Kubernetes manifests, Flux HelmRelease etc...)
- `localization` (required): the resource containing localization rules that can be used to localize the `source`
- `configuration` (optional):
  - a resource containing configuration rules that can be used to configure the localized `source`
  - a resource containing a README file instructing the operator what parameters are available for configuration
- `validation` (required): the resource which can be executed to validate the product has been configured correctly and ready for deployment

Resources may be part of the same component as the `ProductDescription` (local) or may be accessed via a reference to a remote component (remote).

The `ProductDescription` manifest should be an OCM resource with the type: "productdescription.mpas.ocm.software"

## Miscellaneous 

A CLI tool could be provided be used to validate if the component contains a conformant `ProductDescription` manifest and to aid with generating the `ProductDescription`.

Documentation should be provided that describes the available parameters for the `ProductDescription` manifest and provides several usage examples.

## Appendix A: APIs

### A.1. Product Description Manifest

The API for a `ProductDescription` shall be as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: meta.mpas.ocm.software/v1alpha1
kind: ProductDescription
metadata:
  name: string
spec:
  description: string
  pipelineSpecs:
  - name: string # (required)
    source: # (required)
      name: string # resource name
      version: string # resource version
      component: # (optional) if provided the resource is retrieved from this component
        name: string
        version: string
    localization: # (required)
      name: string # resource name
      version: string # resource version
      component: # (optional) if provided the resource is retrieved from this component
        name: string
        version: string
    configuration: # (optional)
      rules:
        name: string # resource name
        version: string # resource version
        component: # (optional) if provided the resource is retrieved from this component
          name: string
          version: string
      readme:
        name: string # resource name
        version: string # resource version
        component: # (optional) if provided the resource is retrieved from this component
          name: string
          version: string
    validation: # (required)
      name: string # resource name
      version: string # resource version
      component: # (optional) if provided the resource is retrieved from this component
        name: string
